Tree is a non-linear (hierarchical) data structure. It provides us a facility to perform insertion/deletion in a constant time. 

My implementation was mainly focused on how to get the depth of any node.
Depth means how much a specific node has a large number of successor as per levels.
To figure this out I have implemented an efficient algorithm that is attached in this file.
