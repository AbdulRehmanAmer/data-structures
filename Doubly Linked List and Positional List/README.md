## Positional List
The positional linked list uses an additional data structure to store/manage the position of each nodes that's lined up in any type of linked lists for fast lookup and access. 
Unlike single linked list that needs to traverse sequentially to seek for the required node, positional linked list gives us a facility of accessing the object in constant time complexity $O(1)$ using array or any collection where our information is kept.
