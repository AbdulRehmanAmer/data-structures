BFS stands for Breadth First Search. This algorithm consist of the following process:

Check all the nodes at the current depth before reaching out to the more depth.

Theoretically speaking, every node associated with some levels because of its hierarchical property. In Bread First method we check all the nodes present in the current level and then go to the next level. 

Time complexity of this algorithm is `O(n)`
