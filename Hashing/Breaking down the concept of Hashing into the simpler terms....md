**Hashing Through Real Life Examples:**

Hashing is about generating the key-value pairs that locates our data in the table or segments where our value/data is kept to the specific position/key.
We can see this concept through one most common example:
	In a library, ever wondered, why we get our required books easily and immediately without searching through all of them? Because they follows the below procedures:
		-Creating the code:
			We calculate the code based on the name of our book and it generates you a short code like a nickname of a book.
		- Map the code: 
			Then you make a map to link the specific segment where the book is kept using that generated nickname. Actually, you have an exact location of the book. Voila! Without searching hundreds of the book, you got your requirements in few seconds. 
		
Hashing is about organizing the data in a well-mannered format such that they can be retrieved and inserted easily and efficiently.
